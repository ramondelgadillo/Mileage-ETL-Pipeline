# Car Mileage Analysis - ETL Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to analyze car mileage data and its relationship with price, brand, and condition. Using Python and SQLite, the pipeline cleans and processes raw data, stores it in a relational database, executes complex queries for insights, and visualizes key findings with Matplotlib. This approach demonstrates how ETL pipelines enable scalable, maintainable data analysis workflows without relying on machine learning models.

## Features
- Extract raw car data from CSV files and load it into pandas DataFrames.
- Clean and transform data by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and categorizing mileage into ranges.
- Load processed data into a PostgreSQL database with structured schemas.
- Perform SQL queries to analyze trends such as average price by mileage range and mileage distribution by brand.
- Visualize analytical results with charts to enhance interpretability.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** — Data processing and scripting.
- **pandas** — Data manipulation and transformation.
- **PostgreSQL** — Relational database storage and querying.
- **SQLAlchemy & psycopg2** — Database connection and interaction.
- **Matplotlib** — Data visualization.

 Charts & Insights


### Setup
1. Install Python (>=3.7) and dependencies:
```bash

    pip install pandas matplotlib sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary


2. Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)

3. Create a PostgreSQL database:

    CREATE DATABASE car_mileage;


Running the Pipeline

Run the scripts sequentially:

python extract.py       # Loads the raw CSV data
python transform.py     # Cleans and categorizes mileage data
python load.py          # Loads transformed data into PostgreSQL
python query.py         # Executes analytical SQL queries
python visualize.py     # Generates charts from query results

Sample Insights

    Cars with mileage between 0–50K have higher average prices, confirming mileage as a key value factor.

    Mileage distribution varies significantly across car brands, reflecting different usage patterns.

    Visualizations provide clear, actionable insights into pricing trends and mileage ranges
